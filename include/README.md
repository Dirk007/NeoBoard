# Configuration

You need to adapt the configurqation to your local setup of WiFi and MQTT.

## Example

First, create a configuration by copying the provided example:

```bash
cp include/config.h.example include/config.h
```

open the file and adapt the definitions to your configuration. This `config.h` file will not be commited by default. You may want to keep it this way.
